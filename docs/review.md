## Gemfire Review

The purpose of this lab is to get a basic understanding of how a Gemfire cluster works and how it can be used.

----

## Exploring gfsh

gfsh (Gemfire shell) is a interactive command line interface that allows you to, manage, moniter and administrate Gemfire processes.

Through out this lab gfsh will be used to start and stop processes and also to initiate other commands to the cluster.

All instructions assume commands are being executed in gfsh and also that gfsh was launched from a new folder.

So do the following:

    $ gfsh
        _________________________     __
       / _____/ ______/ ______/ /____/ /
      / /  __/ /___  /_____  / _____  / 
     / /__/ / ____/  _____/ / /    / /  
    /______/_/      /______/_/    /_/    v8.1.0

    Monitor and Manage GemFire
    gfsh>
 

gfsh is interactive and contains auto completes to assist users. This functionality can be triggered by pressing the tab key. Press tab now to list all the commands gfsh can perform.

## Starting The First Member of the Cluster

The locator is a Pivotal GemFire process that tells new, connecting members/clients where running members are located and provides load balancing for server use. This locator will be the first member in the cluster and will act as the membership coordinator as well as the management node.

Copy and paste the following command into gfsh:  
 
    gfsh> start locator --name=locatorA --enable-cluster-configuration=false --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7575
 

The command will produce an output similar to this:  
 
    gfsh> start locator --name=locatorA --enable-cluster-configuration=false --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7575
    Starting a GemFire Locator in /home/gpadmin/Desktop/BigDataRoadshow/labs/locatorA...

Congratulations, you now have the beginning of a Gemfire cluster! 
  

## Log Into Pulse

GemFire Pulse is a Web Application that provides a graphical dashboard for monitoring vital, real-time health and performance of GemFire clusters, members, and regions. With the first locator started, Pulse is now available. 

To use Pulse, open a browser and enter this URL in the address bar:  http://localhost:7575/pulse/Login.html  

Alternatively the following command can be typed into gfsh to launch Pulse in the browser:

    gfsh> start pulse --url=http://localhost:7575/pulse

Log into Pulse with the following credentials:  

    username: admin
    password: admin

Once logged in click on green server box Icon in the Cluster View to see the Gemfire processes running on the server.  
For the lab all processes will be on this machine.

## Start another Locator

This locator will join with the first giving the cluster fail over for Locator functionality. 

Return to the gfsh session and enter the following command:  

    gfsh> start locator --name=locatorB --enable-cluster-configuration=false --locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] --port=10335 --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7576
 
The resulting output should look like the following:  
 
    gfsh> start locator --name=locatorB --enable-cluster-configuration=false --locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] --port=10335 --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7576
    Starting a GemFire Locator in /home/gpadmin/Desktop/BigDataRoadshow/labs/locatorB...
    .........
    Locator in /home/gpadmin/Desktop/BigDataRoadshow/labs/locatorB on ip-172-31-35-243.ec2.internal[10335] as locatorB is currently online.
    Process ID: 32282
    Uptime: 4 seconds
    GemFire Version: 8.1.0
    Java Version: 1.7.0_45
    Log File: /home/gpadmin/Desktop/BigDataRoadshow/labs/locatorB/locatorB.log
    JVM Arguments: -Dgemfire.locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] -Dgemfire.enable-cluster-configuration=false -Dgemfire.load-cluster-configuration-from-dir=false -Dgemfire.http-service-port=7576 -Dgemfire.launcher.registerSignalHandlers=true -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=9223372036854775806
    Class-Path: /opt/pivotal/gemfire/Pivotal_GemFire_810/lib/gemfire.jar:/opt/pivotal/gemfire/Pivotal_GemFire_810/lib/locator-dependencies.jar
 

Pulse will now show two locator processes. Also in the panel across the top the Total Heap, Members and Locators counts will have increased.

## Add Server A

A GemFire server is a Pivotal GemFire process that runs as a long-lived, configurable member of a distributed system.  
The server is what contains the Regions which in turn contains the data. Servers can also bring the compute to the data, similar to stored Procedures, by deploying java logic into them.  

To start a server process copy the following command into gfsh:  
 
    gfsh> start server --name=serverA --use-cluster-configuration=false --server-port=0 --locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7577 --J=-Dgemfire.start-dev-rest-api=true --J=-Xms128m --J=-Xmx128m

The output will look similar to this:  

    Server in /home/gemfire/serverA on 192.168.75.9[33971] as serverA is currently online.
    Process ID: 88547
    Uptime: 9 seconds
    GemFire Version: 8.1.0
    Java Version: 1.7.0_71
    Log File: /home/gemfire/serverA/serverA.log
    JVM Arguments: -Dgemfire.locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] -Dgemfire.use-cluster-configuration=false -Dgemfire.http-service-port=7577 -Dgemfire.start-dev-rest-api=true -Xms128m -Xmx128m -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=kill -KILL %p -Dgemfire.launcher.registerSignalHandlers=true -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=9223372036854775806
    Class-Path: /home/gemfire/gemfire/Pivotal_GemFire/lib/gemfire.jar:/home/gemfire/gemfire/Pivotal_GemFire/lib/server-dependencies.jar
 

Pulse will now also show the new member as well as the increase in memory capacity the addition of this process provided.  

The members can also be viewed in gfsh by typing this command (remember by pressing tab as you type, autocomplete will help):
 
    gfsh> list members

The output will look something like this:
 
      Name   | Id 
    -------- | ----------------------------------------------
    locatorB | 192.168.75.9(locatorB:72956:locator)<v1>:20048
    serverA  | 192.168.75.9(serverA:88547)<v2>:24402
    locatorA | 192.168.75.9(locatorA:72292:locator)<v0>:58229
 

## Add more Members

To add the rest of the members in the grid, the commands look like this.  

    gfsh> start server --name=serverB --use-cluster-configuration=false --server-port=0 --locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7578 --J=-Dgemfire.start-dev-rest-api=true --J=-Xms128m --J=-Xmx128m
    gfsh> start server --name=serverC --use-cluster-configuration=false --server-port=0 --locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7579 --J=-Dgemfire.start-dev-rest-api=true --J=-Xms128m --J=-Xmx128m
    gfsh> start server --name=serverD --use-cluster-configuration=false --server-port=0 --locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7580 --J=-Dgemfire.start-dev-rest-api=true --J=-Xms128m --J=-Xmx128m
 
To save time these have been bundled up into a single file that can be executed from gfsh. Execute the following command (your actual path may differ):

    gfsh>run --file=[your path]/start-more-servers.gfsh
 
At the end of this process a cluster with six members should be visible in gfsh and pulse.
 
    gfsh>list members
      Name   | Id
    -------- | ----------------------------------------------
    serverB  | 192.168.75.9(serverB:90339)<v3>:5220
    serverD  | 192.168.75.9(serverD:90869)<v5>:14761
    locatorB | 192.168.75.9(locatorB:72956:locator)<v1>:20048
    serverA  | 192.168.75.9(serverA:88547)<v2>:24402
    serverC  | 192.168.75.9(serverC:90642)<v4>:39304
    locatorA | 192.168.75.9(locatorA:72292:locator)<v0>:58229

## Adding Regions

The region is the core building block of the Pivotal GemFire distributed system. All cached data is organized into data regions and you do all of your data puts, gets, and querying activities against them.  
Regions behave like HashMaps in that key/value pairs are put into them.  

There are two Region types:  
1. Replicated - when a client sends data to a server and puts a key/value into this type of Region, that key/value is copied to all servers that have that region.  
2. Partitioned - when a client sends data into this type of Region, a hashing policy is performed on the key and using the result, one of the servers is selected to hold that key/value. In most cases redundant copies are made.  

Regions are usually created using XML that is passed into the server on the start server command.  
This is an example:  

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <cache
        xmlns="http://schema.pivotal.io/gemfire/cache"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://schema.pivotal.io/gemfire/cache http://schema.pivotal.io/gemfire/cache/cache-8.1.xsd"
        version="8.1">
      <cache-server port="${PORT}" max-connections="${MAXCNXS}"/>
      <region name="root">
        <region-attributes refid="REPLICATE"/>
      </region>
    </cache>
    ```

In this lab, to get a better feel for the process, Regions will be created on the fly using gfsh. The downside of this approach is the Regions are not persistent should a member need to be restarted. The xml configuration options is best for this.  

Add the following command in gfsh:
 
    gfsh> create region --name=product --type=REPLICATE
 
It will procude an output like this following:
 
    gfsh>create region --name=product --type=REPLICATE
    Member  | Status
    ------- | --------------------------------------
    serverC | Region "/product" created on "serverC"
    serverB | Region "/product" created on "serverB"
    serverA | Region "/product" created on "serverA"
    serverD | Region "/product" created on "serverD"
 
In the top banner of Pulse the Regions count will also show 1.  

By clicking the Data tab in Pulse the viewer will show one large region.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/32116645-7d1d609c-bb19-11e7-9eb2-424175fae1e7.png)


By click on this grey box, Pulse will show how the data is distributed across the servers.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/32116652-85dc9c16-bb19-11e7-9a39-458608adc230.png)

Now create a Partitioned Region.
 
    gfsh> create region --name=transaction --type=PARTITION --redundant-copies=1
 
For an extra bonus, when using the tab key, the options for Partitioned regions may have come up.
 
    PARTITION                                 
    PARTITION_REDUNDANT                       
    PARTITION_PERSISTENT                      
    PARTITION_REDUNDANT_PERSISTENT            
    PARTITION_OVERFLOW                        
    PARTITION_REDUNDANT_OVERFLOW              
    PARTITION_PERSISTENT_OVERFLOW             
    PARTITION_REDUNDANT_PERSISTENT_OVERFLOW   
    PARTITION_HEAP_LRU                        
    PARTITION_REDUNDANT_HEAP_LRU              
    PARTITION_PROXY                           
    PARTITION_PROXY_REDUNDANT
 
Gemfire has a lot of configuration options to cover a wide range of use cases (more than be covered during this lab).  

Explore the new regions in Pulse.

## Adding Data Using gfsh

Gemfire is a Key/Value store. Both the keys and the values can be objects or JSON.  

For objects there is support for:  
- Java  
- C#  
- C++  

Gemfire can store complex object graphs and even has a query language to transverse such structures.  
To keep things simple this lab will use Strings for Keys and Values.  

Also, in most cases, data is inserted into the cluster from a client application (using one of the previously mentioned lanugages).

For this lab gfsh and the developer REST api will be used.

Run this command in gfsh to do a simple put:
 
    gfsh> put --region=/product --key="123" --value="ABC"
 
The response will look like this:

    gfsh>put --region=/product --key="123" --value="ABC"
    Result      : true
    Key Class   : java.lang.String
    Key         : 123
    Value Class : java.lang.String
    Old Value   : <NULL>
 
## Querying Data

Gemfire uses a Object Query Language called OQL to access data. Functions can also be ran that return results.

Run this command in gfsh to select the record inserted in the previous step:
 
    gfsh>query --query="select * from /product"

    Result     : true
    startCount : 0
    endCount   : 20
    Rows       : 1

    Result
    ---
    ABC

Another option to query data is to click the Data Browser table in Pulse. There is a query editor where OQL can be entered. The results are displayed below.

Type (rather than copy/paste) the same query into the web based Data browser in Pulse.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/32116658-8fdde44a-bb19-11e7-92b8-aa5986f491aa.png)

Since OQL queries objects that can contain methods, some interesting possibilities are available. 

## Adding More Data

In this step data will be added to the Partitioned Region. To do this a gfsh script will be used.
 
    gfsh> run --file=[your path]/transactions.gfsh
 
Messages will scroll past in gfsh showing all the puts occuring.  

To get the number of records in the region, type and run this OQL query in gfsh or the data browser of Pulse (the query needs to be typed into the web based data browser - copy paste will not work):
 
    gfsh> query --query="select count(*) from /transaction"
 
The result should be 1000.

By clicking the Cluster View -> Data in the navigation bar of Pulse it can be seen that the transaction region is now the largest.

Click on this region (the big grey box) will show how the records are distributed.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/32116667-97fe4494-bb19-11e7-8588-5e49d3738547.png)

Leave this view open for the next step.

## Removing a Member

With the data view of Pulse still open bring up the gfsh and enter the following command. Watch the data view in Pulse as this runs.  
 
    gfsh> stop server --name=serverB
 
In a short time the view in pulse will now show the records distributed across three members rather than 4.  
However, when an OQL query is executed to get the count, we are still at 1000 records even after losing a full member.  

    gfsh>query --query="select count(*) from /transaction"

    Result     : true
    startCount : 0
    endCount   : 20
    Rows       : 1

    Result
    --
    1000

    NEXT_STEP_NAME : END
 
This is thanks to our redundant copy. 

To ensure the data is evenly distributed we can run a rebalance command in gfsh:
 
    gfsh>rebalance

    Rebalanced partition regions  /transaction

                                           Rebalanced Stats                                         | Value
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----
    Total bytes in all redundant bucket copies created during this rebalance                        | 18791
    Total time (in milliseconds) spent creating redundant bucket copies during this rebalance       | 365
    Total number of redundant copies created during this rebalance                                  | 57
    Total bytes in buckets moved during this rebalance                                              | 0
    Total time (in milliseconds) spent moving buckets during this rebalance                         | 0
    Total number of buckets moved during this rebalance                                             | 0
    Total time (in milliseconds) spent switching the primary state of buckets during this rebalance | 141
    Total primaries transferred during this rebalance                                               | 5
    Total time (in milliseconds) for this rebalance                                                 | 544

 
This command also prepares the cluster to take more data into the Region after its lost the resources of serverB.

## Adding a Member and Rebalancing

To start the member back up, run this command. Notice the extra flag placed at the end. As before, watch the Pulse Data view while this command runs.  

 
    gfsh> start server --name=serverB --use-cluster-configuration=false --server-port=0 --locators=127.0.0.1[10334],127.0.0.1[10335] --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7577 --J=-Dgemfire.start-dev-rest-api=true --J=-Xms128m --J=-Xmx128m --rebalance
 
The Region was created, but nothing was rebalanced. Why? 

List the Regions in gfsh for that Region for a clue.  

    gfsh> list regions --member=serverB
 
To fix this run the following command in gfsh:
 
    gfsh>create region --name=transaction --type=PARTITION --redundant-copies=1
    Member  | Status
    ------- | --------------------------------------------------------
    serverC | Skipping "serverC". Region "transaction" already exists.
    serverD | Skipping "serverD". Region "transaction" already exists.
    serverA | Skipping "serverA". Region "transaction" already exists.
    serverB | Region "/transaction" created on "serverB"
 
Now run the rebalance command.  

**This concludes the Lab. Thank you for your attention**

## Trouble Shooting

=== Unable to open Firefox in AWS instance
When using an RDP client to connect to AWS, there may be a situation where the desktop render is updated and the running Firefox application is lost from view.  

When attempting to start a new Firefox session, a pop up might be shown stating there is an existing session.  
To fix this run the following commands from a terminal session:  
 
    $ ps -ef | grep firefox
    gpadmin    8207      1  7 Mar25 ?        01:50:17 /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox
    gpadmin   31466  31456  0 02:08 pts/7    00:00:00 grep firefox
    $ kill -9 8207
 

### Invalid Option Error when running commands

When running the commands from the labs, if errors like the following are experienced, ensure these commands are being put into a gfsh session or not just the linux terminal  
 
    $ start locator --name=locatorA --enable-cluster-configuration=false --J=-Dgemfire.http-service-port=7575
    start: invalid option: --name=locatorA
    Try `start --help' for more information.
 

#### A Gemfire Process Does Not Start
When running a start locator or start server command in gfsh, you may see an error like this:
